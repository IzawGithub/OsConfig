# Arch config

This is my personal [aconfmgr](https://github.com/CyberShadow/aconfmgr) config.

## Post install

Make sure to add :

- `.ssh` private keys
- `~/.local/share/gnupg` private certificates

## TODO

- [ ] Don't install `mesa` and `vulkan-radeon` if someone got an Nvidia or Intel GPU

- [ ] Chromium config
- [ ] Freetube config
